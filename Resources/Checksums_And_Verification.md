## 1. Purpose

To verify the **authenticity and integrity** of every software component used in preparing and flashing the Ubuntu 24.04 installation media.
Checksum validation ensures that downloaded files were not corrupted or altered in transit, maintaining a **chain of trust** across all setup tools.

---

## 2. Overview

All files listed below were downloaded directly from their official vendor sources using HTTPS connections.
Each file underwent either a **cryptographic hash verification** or a **macOS Gatekeeper signature check** prior to use.

This process aligns with secure system administration practices and cybersecurity verification standards.

### 4.2 rEFInd Boot Manager Verification

**Command executed:**
`shasum -a 256 refind-bin-0.14.0.2.zip`

**Purpose:** Confirmed that the SourceForge package was complete and untampered.
**Result:** ✅ SHA-256 checksum matched the developer-provided value.

**Evidence:**

### 4.3 balenaEtcher Verification

balenaEtcher’s macOS DMG package includes a built-in code signature verified automatically through **Apple Gatekeeper**.
Installation proceeded only after macOS confirmed the developer certificate issued to **Balena Ltd**.
This ensures the installer was unmodified and signed by its publisher.

**Result:** ✅ macOS signature verified successfully.
