## 4. Compatibility Notes

* The **Apple T2 Security Chip** manages boot authentication, drive encryption, and Touch ID.
  These features require modification (via Recovery) to install third-party operating systems.
* **Wi-Fi, audio, and camera** on this model rely on Apple’s proprietary Broadcom firmware.
  Ubuntu will require additional driver installation (`firmware-b43-installer` for Wi-Fi).
* **All hardware components** were tested and confirmed functional under macOS before installation.
* Verified compatibility with **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Desktop (64-bit AMD/Intel)**.
